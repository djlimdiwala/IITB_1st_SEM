In machine learning, There are thousands of files to be processed more than once iteratively. If file names are like "flower.jpg","sun.jpg","lion.jpg" etc, then It will be very difficult to include  or load them in code. So this script renames all files with numerical sequence.
For example,
flower.jpg  ->  1.jpg
sun.jpg     ->  2.jpg
lion.jpg    ->  3.jpg

and so on...
